    "The idea here is closely related to dynamic programming. For an array $A_n$ of length $n$, we suppose we know the next-greatest-element array for the sub-array $A_{n-1} = A_n[0:n-1]$ of length $n-1$ (i.e. truncating the last element). Then, we add the last element and update the next-greatest-element array. The only elements that have to be updated are the ones with previously unassigned next-greatest element, i.e. those that would have been labled $-1$ in $A_{n-1}$. This is because if an element as a next-greatest element in $A_{n-1}$, that next-greatest element doesn't change when we append an additional element, resulting in $A_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we can maintain a data structure of elements with currently unassigned next-greatest element. We would assign them a next-greatest element whenever a new element introduced is greater then they are. If we also organize the unassigned elements by size, we can efficiently find out which ones need to be assigned at each step. For example, below I use a heap to do this.\n",

    "Each element in $A$ may have to get pushed/popped to the heap, but no more than once. Each of these operations takes $O(log(k))$ where $k$ is the number of elements in the heap. In the worst case the heap may grow to a similar size as $n$, so the complexity of this algorithm is $O(n log(n))$."
